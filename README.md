# Python is Great, yeah!

These notebooks are from *Python for Data Science workshop*, 2017.  I tried to make the jupyter notebooks as much self explanatory as possible to help newcomers to learn Python.

This whole project is in the public domain, you can do whatever you like with it. However, I'd appreciate it very much if you contribute to it.

If you find any mistake or anything needs to be modified, please open an issue and I will fix it asap.
